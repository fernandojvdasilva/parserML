This project is a NLP experiment for non-tagged word clustering using sklearn. I used it as a concept proof for some PhD thesis ideas, but it is not currently stable.

In order to run this experiment you must git clone centering_py and download Summ-It corpus (check at my github account)

PS: It was tested for Portuguese only.
